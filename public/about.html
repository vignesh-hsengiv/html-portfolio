<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Vignesh, 20, studies CSBS at Rajalakshmi Institute of Technology by day—and maybe saves a few data pipelines by night. Passionate about software development and data science, he balances logic and creativity the way some folks balance, say, buildings. With a love for football, Formula 1, and sketching, his brain is in debug mode, but his heart’s always racing. He’s not just writing code—he’s untangling digital webs, solving real-world problems faster than you can say “compile error.” Is he just a regular student? Sure. And maybe that suspicious glow on his IDE isn’t from caffeine. Just maybe.</p>

<p>He travels light—laptop in hand, hoodie optional, danger sense permanently tingling whenever there's buggy code. Whether he’s scaling up software or sketching ideas on the go, Vignesh thrives at the crossroads of tech and creativity. He’s currently sharpening his skills like someone prepping for a midtown swing through machine learning and APIs. His curiosity is radioactive (in a good way), and his drive? Let’s just say it doesn’t come from a bite-sized resume. From hackathons to F1 races, he’s always moving—learning fast, failing faster, and rebooting with the kind of resilience that’d make even the Daily Bugle give him a headline.</p>

<p>On the football field, he’s all speed and instinct; behind a screen, he’s just as agile—dodging bugs like traffic in Manhattan. As a CSBS student, Vignesh explores the tech universe with intention, building real-life projects that stick (sometimes literally, to the whiteboard). He’s not here for glory—he’s here because he knows what code can do when used right. Always learning, always leaping into the unknown, he’s aiming to build a future that actually means something. Sure, he may not wear a mask, but his browser history? That’s a secret identity in itself.</p>
